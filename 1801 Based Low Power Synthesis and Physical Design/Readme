This repository discusses about the Synthesis and Physical Implementation of a design (simple) with Multiple Supply Voltage using a UPF File.
This also includes how to add the isolation cells, retention cells and level shifters to the design inorder to nake the different modules in the core to operate at different power domains or supply voltages.

Directories: 
The following directores consistes of files related to these purposes;
LAB4: 1801-Based RTL-to-Gate Synthesis Using Genus (Legacy Mode)
LAB5: Power -Aware Equivalence Checking with Synthesized Netlist and UPF
LAB6a: 1801 based Physical Design Implementation with Innovus
LAB6b: Power-Aware Equivalence Checking Between a Logical Netlist (Golden) and a Physical Netlist with UPF
RTL: Verilog Codes of the Design
LIBS: PDK Files (*.lib,*.lef, *.capTable) 
1801: UPF file - Describes the power intent of the design
constraints: SDC constraints for synthesis

This repository helps you to design with MSV (Multiple Supply Voltages) and also take Power as critical function to reduce the power in the design.
